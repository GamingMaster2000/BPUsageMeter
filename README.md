To install these repository files for a "bleeding edge build" you can either:

Copy them to the folder your gadget is currently installed in (usually %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows Sidebar\Gadgets\BPUsageMeter.gadget)

OR

You can download these files, Place them in a zip file and rename that file so the extension is .gadget. This will allow you to install the gadget like you would any other.
